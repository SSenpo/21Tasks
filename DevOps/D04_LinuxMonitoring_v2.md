## Chapter I

![linux_monitoringv2.0](images/img4.0)

Planet Earth, USA, California, nowadays.

The working day has just started and you’ve already been called to your superiors. They tell you that your buddy Seb hasn't shown up for work in four days. There is a risk that his task will not be finished on time.
So, now it's your responsibility to figure out the monitoring in Linux, so that you can take over for your careless teammate if necessary.

You enter Seb's office, sit down in front of his computer and immediately open a suspiciously short file with his notes.
While you look over the information that Seb has gathered, you can't stop thinking about the delicious lunch you've left in the break room...


## Chapter II

### **GoAccess**

GoAccess is a log analyser that can handle logs in real time, visualise the information and pass it on via either a terminal or a web browser as a web page.

### **Prometheus**

Time series databases, just as their name implies, are database systems, specifically developed to handle time-related data.

Most systems use relational, table-based databases. Time series databases work differently.
Data is still stored in 'collections', but these collections have one common thing: they aggregate over time.
Basically, this means that for each point that can be saved, there is a timestamp related to it.

Prometheus is a time series database to which an entire ecosystem of tools can be attached to extend its functionality. 
    
Prometheus is created to monitor a wide variety of systems: servers, databases, virtual machines, basically almost anything.

### **Grafana**

Grafana is a platform for data visualisation, monitoring and analysis.
Grafana allows users to create *dashboards* with *panels*, each displaying specific indicators over a set period of time.

Each *dashboard* is universal, so it can be customised for a certain project.

*Panel* is the basic visualisation element of the selected indicators.

*Dashboard* is a set of one or more panels placed in a grid with a set of variables (e.g. server name, application name, etc.).


## Chapter III

- The written bash scripts must be in the src folder
- For each task you must create a folder with the following name: **0x**, where x is the task number.
- All scripts must be decomposed and split into several files
- The main script file for each task must be named **main.sh**
- All scripts should have checks for incorrect input (not all parameters specified, wrong format parameters, etc.)
- All scripts must be run on a virtual machine *Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS*


## Part 1. File generator

After a brief look at the information found on Seb's computer, you walk into the break room and find out that Mike has taken your delicious sandwich, which you specially brought from home.

You can't just let it slide, you have to prank him in return and teach him a lesson.

This will give you a chance to practice working with files in bash scripts. It may be useful in preparing a test environment to set up monitoring tasks.

**== Task ==**

Write a bash script. The script is run with 6 parameters. An example of running a script: 
    
`main.sh /opt/test 4 az 5 az.az 3kb`

**Parameter 1** is the absolute path. 
    
**Parameter 2** is the number of subfolders. 
    
**Parameter 3** is a list of English alphabet letters used in folder names (no more than 7 characters). 
    
**Parameter 4** is the number of files in each created folder. 
    
**Parameter 5** - the list of English alphabet letters used in the file name and extension (no more than 7 characters for the name, no more than 3 characters for the extension). 
    
**Parameter 6** - file size (in kilobytes, but not more than 100).

Folder and file names must only consist of the letters specified in the parameters and use each of them at least 1 time.  
The length of this part of the name should be at least 4 characters, plus the script run date in DD.MM.YY format, separated by underscores, for example: 
    
**./aaaz_021121/**, **./aaazzzz_021121** 

If `az` has been specified for a folder or a file name, there can be no inverse entry: 
    
**./zaaa_021121/** i.e. the order of the characters specified in the parameter must be maintained.

When the script runs in the location specified in parameter 1, the folders and files should be created in them with the appropriate names and sizes. The script should stop running if there is 1GB of free space left on the file system (in the / partition).

Make a log file with data on all created folders and files (full path, creation date, file size).


## Part 2. File system clogging

And now it's time to show Mike what a man whose sandwich has been stolen is capable of.

**== Task ==**

Write a bash script. The script is run with 3 parameters. An example of running a script: 
    
`main.sh az az.az 3Mb`

**Parameter 1** is a list of English alphabet letters used in folder names (no more than 7 characters). 
    
**Parameter 2** the list of English alphabet letters used in the file name and extension (no more than 7 characters for the name, no more than 3 characters for the extension). 
    
**Parameter 3** - is the file size (in Megabytes, but not more than 100).

Folder and file names must only consist of the letters specified in the parameters and use each of them at least 1 time.  
The length of this part of the name should be at least 5 characters, plus the script run date in DD.MM.YY format, separated by underscores, for example: 
    
**./aaaz_021121/**, **./aaazzzz_021121** 

If `az` has been specified for a folder or a file name, there can be no inverse entry: 
    
**./zaaa_021121/** i.e. the order of the specified characters in the parameter must be maintained.

When running the script, file folders must be created in different (any, except paths containing **bin** or **sbin**) locations on the file system.
The number of subfolders is up to 100. The number of files in each folder is a random number (different for each folder). The script should stop running when there is 1GB of free space left on the file system (in the / partition).
Check the file system free space with  `df -h /`.

Make a log file with data on all created folders and files (full path, creation date, file size).

At the end of the script, display the start time, end time and total running time of the script. Complete the log file with this data.


## Part 3. Cleaning the file system

Damn it! You ran the script on the wrong computer. Now you urgently need to write a script to fix it.

**== Task ==**

Write a bash script. The script is run with 1 parameter. The script should be able to clear the system from the folders and files created in [Part 2](#part-2-file-system-clogging) in 3 ways:

1. By log file
2. By creation date and time
3. By name mask (i.e. characters, underlining and date).

The cleaning method is set as a parameter with a value of 1, 2 or 3 when you run the script.

*When deleting by date and time of creation, the user enters the start and end times up to the minute. All files created within the specified time interval must be deleted. The input can be implemented either through parameters or at runtime.*


## Part 4. Log generator

You are finally done with your stuff and ready to continue working out the monitoring.

To begin with, it would be a good idea to create logs that can be analysed.

**== Task ==**

Write a bash script or a C program that generates 5 **nginx** log files in *combined* format. Each log should contain information for 1 day.

A random number between 100 and 1000 entries should be generated per day.
For each entry there should be randomly generated the following:

1. IP (any correct one, i.e. no ip such as 999.111.777.777)
2. Response codes (200, 201, 400, 401, 403, 404, 500, 501, 502, 503)
3. methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
4. Dates (within a specified log day, should be in ascending order)
5. Agent request URL
6. Agents (Mozilla, Google Chrome, Opera, Safari, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge, Crawler and bot, Library and net tool)

Specify in the comments of your script/program what each of the response codes used means.


## Part 5. Monitoring

Now that you have the files to analyse, you can move on to monitoring.

**== Task ==**

Write a bash script to parse **nginx** logs from [Part 4](#part-4-log-generator) via **awk**.
The script is run with 1 parameter, which has a value of 1, 2, 3 or 4.

Depending on the value of the parameter, output the following:

1. All entries sorted by response code
2. All unique IPs found in the entries
3. All requests with errors (response code - 4xx or 5xxx)
4. All unique IPs found among the erroneous requests


## Part 6. **GoAccess**

Watching the results of your efforts in the console is certainly nice, but why not also use a ready-made solution that provides a user-friendly interface?

**== Task ==**

Use the GoAccess utility to get the same information as in [Part 5](#part-5-monitoring)

Open the web interface of the utility on the local machine.


## Part 7. **Prometheus** and **Grafana**

Practice with the logs is over for now. It's time to monitor the state of the system in general.

**== Task ==**

##### Install and configure **Prometheus** and **Grafana** in virtual machine
##### Access the **Prometheus** and **Grafana** web interfaces from a local machine

##### Add to the **Grafana** dashboard a display of CPU, available RAM, free space and the number of I/O operations on the hard disk.

##### Run your bash script from [Part 2](#part-2-file-system-clogging)
##### Check the hard disk load (disk space and read/write operations)

##### Install the **stress** utility and run the following command `stress -c 2 -i 1 -m 1 --vm-bytes 32M -t 10s`
##### Check the hard disk, RAM and CPU load


## Part 8. A ready-made dashboard

After all, why make your own dashboard when, as they say, \"everything has already been stolen before us\"?
Why not get a ready-made dashboard that has all the metrics you need?

**== Task ==**

##### Download the ready-made dashboard *Node Exporter Quickstart and Dashboard* from **Grafana Labs** official website.

##### Run the same tests as in [Part 7](#part-7-prometheus-and-grafana)

##### Start another virtual machine within the same network as the current one
##### Run a network load test using **iperf3**

##### Check the network interface load


## Part 9. Bonus. Your own *node_exporter*

It is always useful and convenient to analyse the system with special utilities, but you have always wanted to understand how they work.

**== Task ==**

Write a bash script or a C program that collects information on basic system metrics (CPU, RAM, hard disk (capacity)). The script or a program should make a html page in **Prometheus** format, which will be served by **nginx**. 
    
The page itself can be refreshed within a bash script or a program (in a loop), or using the cron utility, but not more often than every 3 seconds.

##### Change the **Prometheus** configuration file so it collects information from the page you created.

##### Run the same tests as in [Part 7](#part-7-prometheus-and-grafana)
